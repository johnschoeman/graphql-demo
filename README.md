# GraphQL Tutorial

Get started with GraphQL by converting a RESTful API in a ReactJS/Rails twitter clone into a GraphQL powered API.

This tutorial assumes that you know the basics of GraphQL.

Stage 1: Basic GraphQL server built with Rack
Stage 2: Twitter Clone: Add a GraphQL endpoint for fetching data to a Ruby on Rails application backend.
Stage 3: Twitter Clone: Make a network request to the GraphQL endpoint from a ReactJS frontend.
Stage 4: Twitter Clone: Add write capabilities with GraphQL in the application backend.
Stage 5: Twitter Clone: Make post requests (aka mutations) from the frontend.
