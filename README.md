# GraphQL Tutorial

*Get started with GraphQL by converting a RESTful API in a ReactJS/Rails twitter clone into a GraphQL powered API.*

***Note that this tutorial is currently under construction.***

GraphQL is a modern web API technology that is flexible, provides more efficient client-server communication and makes rapid feature development easier. It has been adopted by companies like GitHub, Pinterest, and Intuit.

The goal of this tutorial is to teach you how to make a GraphQL complient server with Ruby on Rails.  It assumes that you know the most basic GraphQL concepts and terms, Ruby on Rails (including the MVC architecture in general), and enough about JavaScript to make network requests from a client.

This is a fullstack tutorial, but we will mostly be focusing on the Rails side.  The frontend is built with ReactJS and Redux, however you will not need to build any React components so knowledge of React/Redux is not strictly required.  We will be going over how to consume data from our GraphQL powered Rails backend from our React/Redux frontend for completeness.

If you know absolutely nothing about GraphQL, check out the hackathon-guide included in this repo for a currated list of resources to get started with GraphQL.

+ Stage 1: Basic GraphQL server built with ruby.
+ Stage 2: Twitter Clone: Add a GraphQL endpoint for fetching data to a Ruby on Rails application backend.
+ Stage 3: Twitter Clone: Make network queries to the GraphQL endpoint from a ReactJS frontend.
+ Stage 4: Twitter Clone: Add write capabilities (aka mutations) to our GraphQL endpoint in the application backend.
+ Stage 5: Twitter Clone: Initiate mutations from the frontend.
