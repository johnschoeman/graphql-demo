## Tools

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) - An in browser IDE for making GraphQL queries and mutations. This is essential for development of your backend

[GraphCool](https://www.graph.cool/) - A gql based backend as a service.  Very quick to set up and easy to use - Great for creating a mock backend for your front end application.

[GraphCool Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground) - GraphCool's version of GraphiQL, takes a little time to set up but is better than GraphiQL.
